# About Sacha Ligthert

## Introduction
Hi, I am Sacha Ligthert. A 30+ Systems Administrator from Amsterdam.

During the day I work at [The New Motion B.V.](http://newmotion.com/) to beat anything in submission that comes my way. This ranges from faulty EC2 instances, running docker containers running in DC/OS, dealing with AWS oddness and the rare wifi network.
