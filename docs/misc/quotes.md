Why did I take this nickname again?

    [6-2-2014 23:42:36] Tupolov: Why are you dev/random
    [6-2-2014 23:43:45] Sacha Ligthert: ArmA didn't accept the Sha1sum of my full name as nickname..
    [6-2-2014 23:44:02] Sacha Ligthert: So I took a unix device that other people asociated me with in the past. :)
    [6-2-2014 23:44:35] Sacha Ligthert: Sacha was getting kinda boring and ZombiTron would get confusing with scenarios containing zombies.
    [6-2-2014 23:45:10] Sacha Ligthert: And I test the limits of certain tools with a nickname containing characters like /'s. ;)
    [6-2-2014 23:52:26] Tupolov: you did!

Pek says goodbye:

    [1:47:13 PM] Manuel Pekelaer: Gents, Ik heb besloten me niet actief met de community meer te betrekken en niet meer mee te doen aan sessies for the time being
    [1:47:26 PM] Sacha Ligthert: Noted.
    [1:47:50 PM] * Sacha Ligthert kicked mpekelaer from the chat.


Hazey and I discuss our efforts:

    [16:11:38] Sacha Ligthert: Haze, Am I the only one with the impression that our version of insurgency kickstarted groups into adopting alive?
    [16:14:00] Haze: I have seen a few larger groups run alive because of it. Would be interesting to get a download stat from tup when he is around.
    [16:16:22] Sacha Ligthert: Haze, we rock! :D
